# topo-tools-scripts

### Description
A collection of scripts for generating LAMMPS input 
(topology files and run script) for 
simulations of methane and carbon dioxide in MOF-74 and MOF-274 frameworks 
using the DFT-derived FF (https://github.com/rociomer/DFT-derived-force-field).

The main script creates, for each set
of conditions specified, a .tcl script for putting a specific number of guest 
molecules in a simnulation box by reading isotherm data in *isothermData-74/*.
This .tcl script is then run using vmd to generate .data, .in, and 
.in.settings files. It works by reading a *template.in* file, PDB structures 
for frameworks located in *frameworkStructures/*, XYZ structures for guest 
molecules located in *adsorbateStructures/*, and force field parameters 
defined in *forceFieldParamsTemplates/*. A different set of force field template 
files are read depending on if the adsorbate molecule is charged or uncharged. 

### Instructions
To generate LAMMPS input files for carbon dioxide adsorbed in MOF-74, you will
need to run the script *create-LAMMPS-input-74-CO2.sh*. 
Before running, define the "list" of pressures and metal frameworks that you 
want to create input files for at the top of *create-LAMMPS-input-74-CO2.sh*. 
This script will read the respective files from the *isothermData-74/* directory 
(to know how many gas molecules to put in the simulation box), the 
*topoScripts/* directory (for the .tcl template scripts that it uses to 
generate the LAMMPS topology files), and the
*forceFieldParamsTemplates/* directory (for the DFT-FF parameters/charges). 

*template.in* is the file that serves as the template for all the LAMMPS input 
scripts, so any changes made here will then affect all the input files generated 
(this is a good place to change any fixes or dump commands, but note that it
contains many substrings that the *create-LAMMPS-input* scripts search and
replace).

The analogous scripts can be used to generate input files for simulations of
carbon dioxide adsorbed in MOF-274 frameworks, or for methane adsorbed in 
MOF-74.
