# topo-tools

### Description
Scripts for generating LAMMPS input (topology files and run script) for 
simulations of methane and carbon dioxide in MOF-74 and MOF-274 using the
DFT-derived FF. The main script creates, for each set
of conditions specified, a .tcl script for a specific number of guest molecules
 by reading isotherm data in *IsothermData-74/*, then runs this .tcl script 
using vmd to generate .data, .in, and .in.settings files.
                                                                                
The .tcl script reads a template.in file, .pdb structures for frameworks, 
.xyz structures for guest molecules, and force field parameters from 
forceFieldParamsTemplates/. A different force field template file is read 
if the molecule is charged or uncharged. Furthermore, the .in file generated 
will be different if the guest molecule is just a single atom or 
contains many atoms.

### Instructions
To generate LAMMPS input files for CO2/CH4 adsorbed in MOF-74, run 
the script *create-LAMMPS-input-74-CO2.sh*. 
Set the "list" of pressures and metal frameworks you want to create input 
files for at the top of *create-LAMMPS-input-74-CO2.sh*. This script will read 
everything from the *IsothermData-74/* directory 
(to know how many gas molecules to put in the simulation box), *topoScripts/* 
for the .tcl scripts that it uses to generate the LAMMPS topology files, and
*forceFieldParamsTemplates/* for the force field DFT-FF parameters/charges. 

*template.in* is the file that serves as the template for all the LAMMPS input 
scripts, so any changes made here will then affect all the input files generated 
(this is a good place to change any fixes or dump commands).

The analogous scripts can be used to generate input files for simulations in 
MOF-274 frameworks.
